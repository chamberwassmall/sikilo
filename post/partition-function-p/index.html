In this paper we investigate decompositions of the partition function p n from the additive theory of partitions considering the famous Möbius function mu n from multiplicative number theory. The partition function divides data stores into sub-data stores based on a prespecified numeric value or by using the number of files included into the data store itself. Begin aligned 5 41 32 311 221 2111 11111. For example since 4 can be written 1. This function is called the partition function.</p>
