<p>Environmental Protection Agency Washington DC. Iodine partition coefficients defined as the ratio of the concentration of iodine species in the aqueous solution to the iodine concentration in the vapor phase were measured at simulated PWR steam generator conditions 285C and 69 MPa using carrier-free radioactive T I in the form of sodium iodide. The partition coefficient Kp quantifies the equi- librium partitioning of a liquid or supercooled organic solute between two phases K&ndash; cC where Ci and C are the molar concentrations of solute i in phases x and y respectively. Equilibrium partition coefficients were experimentally measured for volatile fission products of cesium and iodine between liquid sodium pool and the inert cover gas to obtain the coefficients at high temperature between 600 and 850 C and to study the dependence of the partition coefficients upon the concentration in the sodium pool. The distribution coefficient for the partition of molecular iodine between water and carbon tetrachloride is 85.</p>

<p>In this experiment the partition coefficient of iodine - K D I 2 - was determined by placing water and iodine dissolved in iso-octane in a separating funnel mixing both solvents thoroughly and by then separating the phases from each other. Equilibrium partition coefficients were experimentally measured for volatile fission products of cesium and iodine between liquid sodium pool and the inert cover gas to obtain the coefficients at high temperature between 600 and 850 C and to study the dependence of the partition coefficients upon the concentration in the sodium pool. I just completed a chemistry practical where I had to determine the partition coefficient of iodine between KI solution and n-hexane. Iodine partition coefficients defined as the ratio of the concentration of iodine species in the aqueous solution to the iodine concentration in the vapor phase were measured at simulated PWR steam generator conditions 285C and 69 MPa using carrier-free radioactive T I in the form of sodium iodide. Three solubility models which alternatively utilize both octanolwater partition coefficients and HPRPLC retention times as predictors of the saturation-limit aqueous activity coefficient will also be compared.</p>
