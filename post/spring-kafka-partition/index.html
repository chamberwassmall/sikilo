		<p><strong>Spring Kafka Partition</strong>. Spring for Apache Kafka. It also provides support for Message-driven POJOs with KafkaListener annotations and a listener container. Spring Boot uses sensible default to configure Spring Kafka. When using Spring Cloud Stream partitioning leave the kafka partitioner to use its default partitioner which will simply use the partition set in the producer record by the binder.</p>
