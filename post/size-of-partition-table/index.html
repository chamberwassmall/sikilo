		<p><strong>Size Of Partition Table</strong>. However if you have for example a table with a lot of data that is not accessed equally tables with data you want to restrict access to or scans that return a lot of data vertical partitioning can help. Using pg_inherits catalog table will help in getting the information of child tables with sizes and later sum them for exact size. Often the only partition table on many PCs today. Below are the important query to check table size of partition and non partitioned tables in Oracle database.</p>

<p>The traditional partitioning scheme MBR partitioning saves partition information on the first sector of disk MBR sectorEach partition entry is 16 bytes and the total is 64 bytes. For a managed non-external table data is manipulated through Hive SQL statements LOAD DATA INSERT etc so the Hive system will know about any changes to the underlying data and can update the stats accordingly. The partition table comprises only125 64bytes of this 512-byte sector. Vertical partitioning on SQL Server tables may not be the right method in every case.
